**Title**: Scalable Distributed Deep Learning for Very Large Sparse Model by Lightening Communication Traffic  
**Presenter**: Daegun Yoon  
**Date**: May 10th, 2022  
**Abstract**: To scale out in large-scale distributed deep learning, training procedure should be optimized by reducing communication overhead between workers and parameter servers (or in all-reduce manner). Communication compression and scheduling schemes are ones showing outstanding performance when strong scaling is desired. Most of all, there remain further optimization points in tensor partitioning and gradient sparsification. We expect that some features in both schemes can be extracted and combined to compensate for severe scaling efficiency usually observed in training of a large-scale sparse model.
